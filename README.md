## README

### tldr

These are maths formula. Not a book. Freely available for everyone. You can contribute by sharing and commenting to make it better(concise/clear and easier to find/revise/memorize).

### Background

#### What is this?

This is my maths formula/notes which I am giving off for free. I am making these notes while I am studying for my MCA Entrance exams. I am studying from class 11/12, JEE Mains and Advanced syllabus.

#### What this isn't?

This is not a book and I make no claims for being complete or thorough. This is just for myself and for you if you find it useful.

#### Why am I doing this?

I am doing this because when I started studying I couldn't find any resource where all the formula, properties and/or definitions were listed. So, I though of making it myself and giving it off for free so others can spend more time studying and less time finding things scattered all over the internet.

#### This is not a book

This is not a book. The book is good. No doubt. What I am trying to do here is to write things in a way that helps me find/revise/remember faster.

### How to use

I would recommend bookmarking this page because most probably you won't find it on Google. Press `ctrl + D` on your PC.

This is the homepage. I will link all the new notes that I write here as I study them. All individual pages will have links to come back to this page at at the bottom.
