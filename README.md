## README

### tldr

These are maths formula. Not a book. Freely available for everyone. You can contribute by sharing and commenting to make it better(concise/clear and easier to find/revise/memorize).

### Background

#### What is this?

This is my maths formula/notes which I am giving off for free. I am making these notes while I am studying for my MCA Entrance exams. I am studying from class 11/12, JEE Mains and Advanced syllabus.

#### What this isn't?

This is not a book and I make no claims for being complete or thorough. This is just for myself and for you if you find it useful.

#### Why am I doing this?

I am doing this because when I started studying I couldn't find any resource where all the formula, properties and/or definitions were listed. So, I though of making it myself and giving it off for free so others can spend more time studying and less time finding things scattered all over the internet.

#### This is not a book

This is not a book. The book is good. No doubt. What I am trying to do here is to write things in a way that helps me find/revise/remember faster.

### How to use

I would recommend bookmarking this page because most probably you won't find it on Google. Press `ctrl + D` on your PC.

This is the homepage. I will link all the new notes that I write here as I study them. All individual pages will have links to come back to this page at at the bottom.

### Discussion and Commenting

#### Discussion

Discussion should be done where it is most relevant. This is where you get help or give your suggestions.

You can comment on any specific part of any page by highlighting/selecting it and typing your comment on the box that appears. You might need to be signed up to HackMD to use this feature. This is where you should discuss about the topic eg. improvement/correction/suggestion.
Do not use this section for thanking/ranting.

#### Comments

You can use the comment at the bottom of every page to make any comment that is not directly related to the topic. You might need be signed up to Disqus though Google/Facebook/email.

Comments can contain thanking/ranting. Do not use this section to discuss related to topic since it might get lost in the comments and would be harder to pin point where exactly you need help/have suggestions for.
