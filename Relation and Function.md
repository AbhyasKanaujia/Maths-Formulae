## Relation

Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets then Relations $R$ from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$ i.e. $R \subseteq A \times B$

Also, If $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ then, 

$R = \{(a, b) : a \in A$ and $b \in b \}$

This can be denoted by $xRy\Leftrightarrow$ condition where $x \in A$ and $y \in B$

e.g. Let $A={a, b, c, d}$ and $B={1, 2, 3, 4}$

Let, 

* $R_1= \{(b, 3), (b, 4), (a, 3)\}$ is a relation
* $R_2 = \{ (a, 1) \}$ is a relation
* $R_3=\{ (a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3), (d, 4) \}$ is a relation
* $aR_4b \Leftrightarrow x$ divides $y$ 
* $R_5 = \{ (a, 4), (c, 1), (3, d) \}$ is **not** a relation, $\because (3, d) \notin A \times B$
* $R_6  = \{ (1, a), (2, c), (3, d) \}$ is **not** a relation, $\because R_5 \not\subseteq A \times B$

## Domain, co-domain and Range of $R$

### Domain

Set of all the first element of order pair in relation $R$.

$\therefore$ Domain of $R= \{ a: (a, b) \in R \}$

### Range 

Set of all the second element of order pair in relation $R$.

$\therefore$ Domain of $R= \{ b: (a, b) \in R \}$

### Codomain

Set of all elements of set $B$.

$a\in A$

## Total number of Possible Relations

Let $n(A) = m$ and $n(B)=n$

$\because n(A \times B) = mn$

$\therefore$ Total number of possible relations $= 2^{mn}$ (This is same as number of subsets of $A \times B$)
